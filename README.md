# Reverse_Logistics

## Overview
Optimize customer transportation truck (inland) costs from the city to the port of loading/discharge creating a *win-win* relationship.

## Why a Win-Win?
**Customer** will not only save in costs but also will contribute to a cleaner environment. On the other hand, the **Company** will have a higher profit and will also positively impact to a better natural environment.

## Motivation
Freight Forwarders are more and more struggling with getting business due to a highly competitive industry mainly focused on cost savings. This will help the company to be extremely competitive vs other competitors by providing to our Strategic Accounts Managers a new tool that will help them in their negotiations with our customers.
